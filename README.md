# Rescope Commerce Sample Store

** SQL Server is recommended instead of SQLite for this project **

![Rescope Commerce Demo Store Homepage](/docs/home.png)

This project demonstrates a sample implementation of **Rescope Commerce** for **Umbraco**.
It provides a functional example of how to set up a Rescope Commerce-powered storefront.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is quick and easy:

1. Clone the repository and initialise the project as you would any standard Umbraco installation.
2. Log in to the Umbraco backoffice.
3. Navigate to **Settings** and perform a full **uSync import**.

This will import all necessary Rescope Commerce configurations for the demo store.

### Payment Provider Configuration

Please note: **Rescope Commerce's uSync handlers do not synchronise sensitive information**, such as payment provider secrets.

Before testing the checkout process, you will need to manually configure a payment provider in the backoffice under the Commerce section.

## Project Structure

This project is structured to demonstrate key concepts and components of a basic Rescope Commerce integration.
Key folders and files include:

### `Controllers/`
- `BasketSurfaceController.cs` — Handles surface actions for basket operations on the front-end.
- `CheckoutSurfaceController.cs` — Handles surface actions related to the checkout process.
- `CheckoutController.cs` — Hijacks the rendering of the Checkout page to provide a custom flow.

### `Views/`
- `Checkout/` — Contains all front-end pages related to the checkout flow.
- `Basket.cshtml` — Displays the shopping basket.
- `_ViewStart.cshtml` — Shared view configuration.
